# Meteor Storm 3D
Can you survive the meteor storm?

Fresh off his hit, **Meteor Storm**, published in the [November 1980 edition of SoftSide magazine](https://archive.org/details/softside-magazine-26), Roy Harper is at it again. This time he's added a new dimension in the exciting sequel, **Meteor Storm 3D**.

You must find your way through the meteor storm. Avoid the red and orange meteors, they will only slow you down. Collide with the green meteors to accelerate. And what does that purple meteor do?

Use the arrow keys or the mouse to navigate through the game.
